Slide 1
=======
Goal

Claim
 - Plotkin's lambda calculus is incomplete

Proof method:
 - Extension of Plotkin's calculus to form
    - CPS transformation
    - invserse CPS transformation

 - Validation using observational equivalence

Slide 2
=======
Observational Equivalence
 - prove correctness of transformation
 - holds true if the filling of each context results in:
     - undefined or
     - defined

Slide 3
=======
Soundness of lambda
 - By value lambda calculi
     - sound by observational equivalence in a typed setting
 - By name lambda calculi
     - sound if language does not observe termination behavior

Slide 4
======
Question
 - which set of axioms can prove that pairs of expressions are equal after transformation?
 - must be provable for both:
     - by value lambda calculi
     - by name lambda calculi

Slide 5
=======
Problem
 - By name lambda calculi are more sound than by value lambda calculi for beta reductions
 - Eta reductions' effects are unknown for both calculi
 - proposed solution:
     - remedy situation by deriving a set of axioms that are
         - contextually equivalent
         - observationally equivalent after applying reductions

Slide 6
=======
CPS transformation
 - composite transformation of 
     - modified Fischer transformation
     - normalized beta and eta reductions
 - evaluates redexes by lifting to base of program
 - result
     - parameterized context

Slide 7
======
Inverse transformation
 - Evaluation context of the CPS transformation
 - Not a full inverse since
     - some terms are a composite
     - some are not the mapping of any term

Slide 8
======
Studied correlation
 - axioms can be derived via 
     - partial inverse of the CPS transformation
 - axioms are sound with respect to observational equivalence of the CPS' transformation terms

Slide 9
=======
Findings
 - sound for beta eta reasoning about CPS programs
 - dynamically typed languages were unsound
 - scheme-like languages are sound with respect to observational equivalence
